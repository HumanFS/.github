# 🚀 The Human File System Collective Superteam DAO 🚀

HumanFS DAO is a collective of separate HackFS teams cooperating to accelerating clinical discovery and reduce suffering. 

Together, we are creating a set of interoperable software libraries that can be used independently to create user-accesss controlled digital twins on the blockchain.
The libaries can be used independently, but will all be included in the HumanFS SDK.
